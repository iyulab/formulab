## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-05

### Changed (breaking within 0.x) — standard-table conformance sweep

Four independently transcribed lookup tables were found to diverge from their cited
standards (origin: upstream-006, forge-fmea). Each was re-verified cell-by-cell against
the standard or a cell-complete reproduction; all changes move outputs **toward the
published standard**, and every fix ships with cell-level golden tests.

- **`quality/actionPriority()` — AIAG-VDA 2019 AP table conformance** (upstream-006):
  - Occurrence bands were a copy of the severity bands (`4-6/7-8/9-10`); corrected to the
    handbook's `4-5/6-7/8-10`. Detection bands corrected from five bands to the handbook's
    four (`1/2-4/5-6/7-10`) — **`detectionGroup` in the result now ranges 0–3 (was 0–4)**
    and `occurrenceGroup` boundaries moved.
  - The S=1 row is now all-L and the O=1 rows all-L per the handbook (e.g.
    `{S:1, O:10, D:10}` returned `'H'`, now `'L'`). Boundary verdicts moved at O=5/6, O=7/8
    and D=6/7 splits.
  - Verification: Relyence FMEA user-guide reproduction of the handbook table (cell-complete,
    re-extracted twice) + structural invariants; handbook hardcopy not consulted — flagged
    for anyone with 1st-edition access to spot-audit.
- **`safety/ergonomicRisk()` (REBA) — Tables A/B re-transcribed from the published REBA
  worksheet** (Hignett & McAtamney 2000 / Hedge worksheet): 14 of 15 Table A rows and 10 of
  12 Table B rows were a smoothed monotone pattern, not the published values (Table A even
  reached 12; the standard caps at 9; the irregular cells `N3/T1 = 3,3,5,6` and the
  duplicated `N1/N2` Trunk-1 rows were missing). Table C, load score, risk levels were
  already correct. Trunk extension now caps at 3 and upper-arm extension at 2 per the
  worksheet zones (previously |angle| symmetric).
- **`safety/nioshLifting()` — FM/CM tables conformed to NIOSH 94-110 Tables 5 & 7**:
  - CM for fair coupling was inverted (`V<75: 1.0, V≥75: 0.95`; the manual says
    `V<75: 0.95, V≥75: 1.00`) — and the prior test pinned the inverted value while citing
    Table 7.
  - FM now carries the manual's V<75/V≥75 columns: at high frequencies with V<75cm the
    published FM is 0.00 (→ `rwl: 0`, `liftingIndex: Infinity`, the documented sentinel);
    previously the more permissive V≥75 column was used everywhere. Invented FM values that
    do not exist in Table 5 were removed (medium-duration F13-15 `0.19/0.17/0.15` → 0, long
    F11-12 `0.11/0.10` → 0), and frequency >15 lifts/min now yields FM 0 (was clamped to the
    F=15 value). All changes are conservative (lower or equal RWL).
- **`quality/aql()` — re-transcribed from ISO 2859-1:1999 Tables 1 & 2-A** (scanned table
  images from the published standard, cell-by-cell):
  - Table 1: the S-1/S-2/S-3 code-letter columns promoted one lot-size band late in many
    rows (e.g. lot 281–500 at S-1 is code **B**, not A). S-4 and general levels I/II/III
    were already correct.
  - Table 2-A: nearly every Ac/Re pair sat one ladder step too permissive — an off-by-one
    introduced by omitting the standard's 0.15 AQL column (e.g. code J at AQL 6.5 accepted
    on 14 nonconforming; the standard accepts on 10). The 0.15 AQL level is now supported.
    The fixed-sample-size simplification of arrow cells is unchanged and now documented in
    the JSDoc.

- **`environmental/gwpCalculator()` — two AR6 cells corrected** (single-axis constant
  audit): SF6 GWP100 `25,200` → **`24,300`** (AR6; cross-checked against the GHG Protocol
  AR6 GWP tables v2.0 and independent AR6 citations) and CH4 GWP500 `7.6` → **`10.0`**
  (the 7.6 was AR4's value left in an otherwise-AR6 table; 10.0 is AR6 fossil methane,
  consistent with the fossil 20/100-year values already used). The JSDoc now states the
  CH4 row uses AR6 *fossil* methane values. Remaining unverified 500-year cells
  (NF3/SF6/HFC-152a GWP500) are noted in the audit log but unchanged.

### Added

- **`quality`: AP matrix exported for consumers** (upstream-006 feature request) —
  `AP_TABLE` (`[severityGroup][occurrenceGroup][detectionGroup]`, deep-readonly) and
  `AP_SEVERITY_BANDS` / `AP_OCCURRENCE_BANDS` / `AP_DETECTION_BANDS`
  (`ApRatingBand { min, max }[]`, index = group), so matrix visualizations don't need a
  locally duplicated table.
- **`safety/ergonomicRisk()`: REBA Step 11 coupling** — optional
  `coupling?: 'good' | 'fair' | 'poor' | 'unacceptable'` input (+0…+3 to Score B, default
  `'good'` preserves existing calls) and `couplingScore` in the result.

### Docs

- README: function tables and domain counts synced to the actual exports (217 functions;
  `actionPriority`/`cpkToOccurrence`/`nelsonRules` rows and the whole Industrial
  Engineering section were missing); ERRORS.md quality rows completed; CLAUDE.md now
  prescribes lookup-table transcription discipline (cell-level golden tests, irregular-cell
  pins, invariant tests).

## [0.13.8] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **`formulab/metal`: re-export the weld-heat code types referenced by `WeldHeatResult`** — addresses online-tools ISSUE-20260621-formulab-weld-type-exports. The 0.13.7 i18n additions surfaced `preheatTemp.sourceCode: WeldPreheatSourceCode` and `recommendationCodes: WeldRecommendation[]` on the exported `WeldHeatResult`, but the supporting type aliases `WeldPreheatSourceCode`, `WeldRecommendationCode`, and `WeldRecommendation` were defined in `types.ts` yet missing from the `metal/index.ts` barrel — so consumers could not name them (`TS2305: Module 'formulab/metal' has no exported member 'WeldRecommendation'`). All three are now re-exported alongside `WeldHeatInput`/`WeldHeatResult`. Type-only change; no runtime or behavioral impact.

## [0.13.7] - 2026-06-21

### Changed (breaking within 0.x)

- **Safety domain: clamp/`Infinity`/0-guard validation migrated to the standard error policy (12 functions)** — the v0.13.5/0.13.6 zero-fill sweep was return-pattern-driven and missed the safety domain, where invalid inputs were masked by `Math.max/min` clamping, `Infinity`, or 0-guards rather than `throw` (reported by online-tools: ISSUE-20260621-formulab-validation-gaps-pid-safety-domain — gap 2). For an accuracy-critical domain this left no defense-in-depth for non-page consumers. The following now **throw `RangeError`** with a per-constraint message:
  - `arcFlash()` (voltage/boltedFaultCurrent/workingDistance/faultClearingTime/gapBetweenConductors ≤ 0), `illuminance()` (roomLength/roomWidth/lumensPerLuminaire/targetLux ≤ 0, or luminaireHeight ≤ workplaneHeight — **return-type behavior change**: previously returned an all-zero result), `lel()` (gas with negative concentration or non-positive LEL), `respiratorCalculate()` (oel ≤ 0 — **was a tested `Infinity` return**; concentration < 0), `confinedSpace()` (oxygenPercent outside 0–100, or any negative gas reading; customGas pel/idlh ≤ 0), `thermalComfort()` (relativeHumidity outside 0–100, metabolicRate ≤ 0, clothingInsulation < 0, airVelocity < 0), `nioshLifting()` (negative distance/angle/frequency/loadWeight), `ladderAngle()` (negative height/baseDistance; ladderLength ≤ 0 when used as a given), `fallClearance()` (workerHeight ≤ 0, or negative distances), `havsCalculate()` (negative tool vibrationMagnitude/exposureTime), `noiseExposure()` (negative exposure duration), `ergonomicRisk()` (load < 0).
  - **Boundaries deliberately preserved** (valid degenerate domain answers, not invalid input): `confinedSpace()` accepts a reading of `0` (a valid, possibly catastrophic measurement); `fallClearance()` keeps anchorHeight ≤ 0 → `isAdequate=false` + warning; `thermalComfort()`/`wbgtCalculate()` accept negative °C temperatures; `ergonomicRisk()` accepts negative joint angles (flexion/extension); empty tool/exposure/gas lists report no-exposure. **Intentional `Infinity` sentinels kept** (and now documented in `ERRORS.md`): `respiratorCalculate().safetyMargin = Infinity` when concentration = 0 (no hazard), `nioshLifting().liftingIndex = Infinity` when RWL = 0 (no acceptable weight) — both from valid inputs, analogous to the `cpk`/`ppk`/`cmk` degenerate-spread exception. `wbgtCalculate()` remains `safe` (no invalid-input class).
- **`lel()` status thresholds conservatized (NT-14)** — the mixed-gas `%LEL` status used `safe < 25 / caution 25–50 / danger > 50`, more permissive than the industry `%LEL` convention used everywhere else in the library (`confinedSpace()` and all locale docs: `safe < 10 / caution 10–25 / danger > 25`, evacuate above 25% LEL). `lel()` now follows the same `10 / 25` convention. **Behavior change**: the `status` field returns `caution`/`danger` at lower `%LEL` than before (e.g. 20% LEL: `safe` → `caution`; 40% LEL: `caution` → `danger`). Numeric outputs (`mixtureLel`, `percentOfLel`, `safetyMargin`) are unchanged.

### Added

- **`weldHeat()`: machine-readable i18n codes (additive, backward-compatible)** — addresses online-tools ISSUE-20260621-formulab-weldheat-recommendations-no-code, where consumers could only render the English `recommendations` prose and `preheatTemp.source` string (i18n required brittle reverse-mapping or re-implementing the branch logic — both layer-violating anti-patterns). The result now also carries:
  - `preheatTemp.sourceCode: 'awsTable' | 'awsJudgment' | 'engineeringJudgment'` alongside the unchanged `source` string.
  - `recommendationCodes: { code, params }[]` parallel (index-aligned) to `recommendations`, with stable codes (`preheat`, `fastCooling`, `pwht`, `stainlessInterpass`, …) and interpolation params (e.g. `{ min, max, source }`, `{ t85 }`, `{ hazHardnessMax }`). Consumers map `code` → a localized template and interpolate `params`. The existing `recommendations`/`source` strings are untouched.

## [0.13.6] - 2026-06-21

### Changed (breaking within 0.x)

- **Invalid-input zero-fill results migrated to the standard error policy — tail of the v0.13.5 sweep** — the v0.13.5 sweep missed a set of public functions that still returned an all-zero/sentinel result object on must-be-positive invalid input instead of throwing (reported by online-tools: ISSUE-20260621-formulab-zerofill-invalid-guards, which independently reproduced user-facing zero-fills the prior full-audit had marked drained). `ERRORS.md` already documented several of these as `throw` (aspirational); the code now conforms. All of the following now **throw `RangeError`** with a per-constraint message, consistent with the rest of the library — consumers branch on the boundary, not on a zero result:
  - **metal**: `bolt()` (diameter/pitch/kFactor/tensileStrength ≤ 0; torque ≤ 0 in `torqueToPreload`, preload ≤ 0 in `preloadToTorque` — all six former zero-fill paths), `pressFit()` (shaftDiameter/holeDiameter/hubOuterDiameter/contactLength ≤ 0 — the clearance-fit `interference ≤ 0` and `hubOuterDiameter ≤ shaftDiameter` results are legitimate physical states and **kept**), `spring()` (wireDiameter/meanCoilDiameter/activeCoils ≤ 0), `tap()` (majorDiameter/pitch ≤ 0), `welding()` (thickness ≤ 0 — previously returned empty recommendations + zero rod diameter).
  - **logistics**: `dimWeight()` (length/width/height ≤ 0; actualWeight < 0 — zero actual weight stays legit, billing falls back to dimensional weight), `fillRate()` (totalOrders ≤ 0), `freightClass()` (weight/length/width/height ≤ 0), `kanban()` (dailyDemand/leadTime/containerQuantity ≤ 0), `pickTime()` (speed/itemsPerOrder ≤ 0).
  - **electronics**: `smtTakt()` (placementRate/componentsPerBoard ≤ 0), `solderPaste()` (padCount/stencilThickness ≤ 0).
  - **energy**: `motorEfficiency()` (currentEfficiency/newEfficiency ≤ 0).
  - **automotive**: `batteryRuntime()` (capacityAh ≤ 0 — completing the voltageV/loadW guards added in 0.13.5).
  - **chemical**: `ph()` (acidConcentration/baseConcentration ≤ 0), `pid()` (non-positive process parameters in every method branch — processGain/deadTime/timeConstant ≤ 0 for Z-N step & Cohen-Coon, ultimateGain/ultimatePeriod ≤ 0 for Z-N ultimate; previously returned all-zero gains).
  - **quality**: `aql()` (lotSize ≤ 0).
  - **construction**: `slope()` (ratio ≤ 0 — a 1:N ratio with N ≤ 0 is vertical/undefined, previously inverted to "flat 0%"; percent/degrees value 0 stays legit flat ground).
- **Intentionally kept** (unchanged): `cpk()`/`ppk()`/`cmk()` degenerate-spread zero result (stdDev ≤ 0 → zero indices — a computable degenerate case, not invalid input); `kanban()` negative `safetyFactor` zero-fill and `fillRate()` `serviceLevel()` (not must-be-positive); all legitimate-zero computations (e.g. automotive `power()`/`torque()`, energy `carbonFootprint()` where 0 input = 0 output). `ERRORS.md` condition descriptions corrected for the migrated functions.

## [0.13.5] - 2026-06-18

### Changed (breaking within 0.x)

- **Invalid-input `return null` / zero-fill results migrated to the standard error policy across 8 domains** — a systematic sweep (reported by online-tools: ISSUE-20260612-formulab-null-returns-full-audit) found ~25 public functions that returned `null` or an all-zero/sentinel result object on invalid input instead of throwing, contradicting `ERRORS.md`. `ERRORS.md` itself was found to be aspirational for several of these (it claimed `throw` where the code 0-filled) and has been corrected to match the code. All of the following now **throw `RangeError`** with a per-constraint message:
  - **automotive**: `fuelEconomy()` (value ≤ 0), `evCharging()` (socEndPercent ≤ socStartPercent, chargerPowerKw ≤ 0), `batteryRuntime()` (voltageV ≤ 0, loadW ≤ 0), `gearRatio()` (drivingTeeth ≤ 0).
  - **energy**: `insulationRoi()` (surfaceArea/tempDifference/insulationK/insulationThickness ≤ 0), `degreeDay()` (empty `dailyTemps`).
  - **food**: `calorie()` (weightKg/heightCm/age ≤ 0).
  - **metal**: `cutting()` (toolDiameter ≤ 0), `bearing()` (dynamicLoadRating/equivalentLoad/rpm ≤ 0), `roughness()` (value ≤ 0), `weldHeat()` (voltage/current/travelSpeed/thickness ≤ 0), `vibration()` (non-positive system/geometry field; innerDiameter ≥ outerDiameter), `pressTonnage()` (combined operation without `operations`). **Return type changes** (`... | null` → non-nullable): `cuttingStock()` (empty pieces, zero total quantity, stockLength ≤ 0, piece > stockLength), `material()` (unknown category/grade), `screw()` (unknown designation), `thread()` (unknown size), `tolerance()` (nominal size out of range, unknown IT grade / deviation letter).
  - **quality**: `mtbf()` (totalOperatingTime ≤ 0, numberOfFailures ≤ 0 — with zero failures MTBF is undefined; the previous `0` wrongly read as "fails constantly"), `dpmo()` (units ≤ 0, opportunities ≤ 0), `lineBalancing()` (empty tasks, cycleTime ≤ 0, a task time > cycleTime, circular dependency; `... | null` → non-nullable).
  - **electronics**: `viaCurrent()` (holeDiameter/platingThickness/viaLength/tempRise ≤ 0; `... | null` → non-nullable).
  - **logistics**: `shipping()` (weight/volume ≤ 0, truck distance ≤ 0, unknown mode; `... | null` → non-nullable), `tsp()` (empty nodes; `... | null` → non-nullable).
  - **construction**: `pert()` (empty tasks, circular dependency; `... | null` → non-nullable).
- **Lookup-miss policy unified to throw** — unknown designation/grade/size/category (`material`/`screw`/`thread`/`tolerance`) now throw, consistent with the rest of metal (`hardness`/`pipeSpec`/`flangeSpec`). Consumers branch on the boundary, not on `null`.
- **Intentionally kept** (not invalid input): `npv().irr` non-convergence null; `nelsonRules()` internal rule-helper nulls (never surfaced); `pallet3d()` internal placement-helper null; `cpk()`/`ppk()`/`cmk()` degenerate-spread zero result; `energyDensity()` missing-mass null.

## [0.13.4] - 2026-06-18

### Changed (breaking within 0.x)

- **`earthwork()` / `formwork()` (construction): zero-filled result on invalid input migrated to the standard error policy** — both functions previously returned an all-zero result for non-positive dimensions instead of throwing, and their existing tests encoded that as an "edge case". They now **throw `RangeError`** with a per-constraint message, matching `ERRORS.md` (which already documented them as `throw`) and the beamLoad/compressedAirCost migrations:
  - `earthwork()`: non-positive `length`/`width`/`depth`, or non-positive `swellFactor`/`shrinkFactor` (a zero factor silently produced a zero loose/compacted volume).
  - `formwork()`: non-positive dimension **consumed by the element type's area formula** (column/beam/footing → length, width, height; slab → length, width; wall → length, height) or non-positive `quantity`. Dimensions a given element type ignores (slab height, wall width) are left unvalidated, so a formula-irrelevant zero is still accepted. `reuses ≤ 0 → 1` remains intentional lenient behavior.

  Reported by online-tools: ISSUE-20260618-formulab-earthwork-formwork-zerofill (NT-9). `ERRORS.md` condition text updated from "Negative dimensions" to the precise non-positive constraints.

## [0.13.3] - 2026-06-12

### Changed (breaking within 0.x)

- **`compressedAirCost()` (energy): `costPerCfm` renamed to `costPerFt3`** — the value is total cost divided by delivered volume in cubic feet ($/ft³); "CFM" is a flow rate (ft³/min), so the old name was dimensionally wrong (the conversion comment also incorrectly read "1 m3 = 35.3147 CFM"). Reported by online-tools: ISSUE-20260612-formulab-compressedaircost-cfm-dimension-zerofill.
- **`compressedAirCost()`: zero-filled result on invalid input migrated to the standard error policy** — non-positive `compressorPower`/`runningHours`/`airOutput` now **throws `RangeError`** with a per-constraint message instead of returning an all-zero result. Note: zero-fill returns are not caught by `return null` scans — the null-returns audit (ISSUE-20260612-formulab-null-returns-full-audit) should also cover this pattern.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-06-12

### Changed (breaking within 0.x)

- **`beamLoad()` (construction): `LoadResult | null` migrated to the standard error policy** — now **throws `RangeError`** with a per-constraint message (non-positive span, missing `uniformLoad`/`pointLoad` for the selected load type) instead of returning `null`, matching ERRORS.md and the 0.13.0 utility migration. Also adds a new guard: `pointPosition` outside `[0, span]` now throws (previously produced physically meaningless negative moments). Return type is non-nullable. Reported by online-tools: ISSUE-20260612-formulab-beamload-null-returns.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **`statistics()` gains `sampleVariance` / `sampleStdDev`** — sample statistics with Bessel's correction (divisor n−1), `undefined` when the data set has fewer than 2 values. The existing `variance`/`stdDev` remain population statistics (divisor n) and are now explicitly documented as such in JSDoc and `StatisticsResult`. Additive and non-breaking. Practitioner-facing calculators typically need the sample variant for measured data (reported by online-tools: ISSUE-20260612-formulab-statistics-population-vs-sample).

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-11

### Changed (breaking within 0.x)

- **`utility` domain: `Result | null` signatures migrated to the standard error policy** — 16 functions (`assignment`, `bilinearInterpolation`, `correlation`, `depreciation`, `histogram`, `lcc`, `linearInterpolation`, `movingAverage`, `normalize`, `npv`, `percentile`, `regression`, `roi`, `statistics`, `unit`, `weightedScore`) now **throw `RangeError`** with a descriptive, per-constraint message instead of returning `null` on invalid input, matching every other domain and ERRORS.md. Return types are now non-nullable. `NpvResult.irr: number | null` is intentionally kept — IRR non-convergence is a domain answer, not invalid input. Consumers that branched on `null` should catch `RangeError` instead (reported by online-tools: ISSUE-20260610-formulab-utility-null-returns).
- **`effectiveDiameter()` (machining): placeholder `effectiveRpm: 0` removed** — the result no longer hard-codes a zero RPM (reported by online-tools: ISSUE-20260610-formulab-effectivediameter-rpm-placeholder). The function now returns:
  - `rpmCorrectionFactor` (= D / Deff, always present) — multiply nominal RPM by this to keep the programmed surface speed at depth;
  - `effectiveRpm?` — computed as `(Vc × 1000) / (π × Deff)` only when the new optional `cuttingSpeed` (m/min) input is provided; omitted otherwise (never 0-filled).
  Also adds input validation (`RangeError` on non-positive D/ap, ap > D, non-positive Vc) and clamps `Deff = D` beyond the equator (ap > D/2) where the previous formula incorrectly decreased.

### Fixed

- **`lineBalancing()` (quality): successors can now share a station with their predecessors** — the RPW assignment marked a task "completed" only when its station closed, which forced every successor into a later station and inflated the station count to the precedence-chain depth (e.g. a 5-task chain with a generous cycle time produced 4 stations and 5% line efficiency instead of 1 station / 20%). Standard RPW (Helgeson & Birnie) allows same-station placement because the within-station sequence preserves precedence. Reported by online-tools: ISSUE-20260611-formulab-linebalancing-same-station-precedence.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **`controlChart()` gains `chartType: 'imr'`** — Individuals & Moving-Range (I-MR) chart for single-value time series where subgroup size = 1. Computes X̄ ± E₂·MR̄ control limits for the Individuals chart and D₄·MR̄ for the MR chart (d₂=1.128, E₂=2.66, D₄=3.267; AIAG SPC 2nd Ed. / Montgomery). `sigmaEstimate` uses σ̂ = MR̄/d₂; first data point carries no moving range (`subgroupStats[0].range` is `undefined`). Additive — existing Xbar-R/S code paths are unchanged. New `ControlChartType` union member: `'imr'`.
- **`histogram()` gains optional `range`** — `HistogramInput` now accepts `range?: [number, number]` to specify an explicit `[min, max]` binning window. Useful when spec limits or reference bounds extend beyond the data span. Falls back to data-derived min/max when the provided range is invalid (`range[1] <= range[0]`). Values outside the supplied range are clamped into the first or last bin. `totalCount` always reflects the actual data length. Additive and non-breaking.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **`cpk()` now returns `withinSpecPercent`** — estimated percentage of output within `[LSL, USL]` under a normal model, mirroring `ppk()`. The capability (`cpk`) and performance (`ppk`) result shapes are now symmetric, so consumers no longer need to recompute the within-spec fraction with `normalCDF`. `CpkResult` gains the field (additive, non-breaking). For `cpk()` this is a short-term/potential estimate (uses the supplied short-term σ); see the function JSDoc.
- **`ppk()` gains cpk-aligned field names** — `PpkResult` now also exposes `ppu`, `ppl`, and `sigmaLevel` (matching `cpk()`'s `cpu`/`cpl`/`sigmaLevel`). Additive and non-breaking; values are identical to the existing fields.

### Changed

- **`cpk()` outputs are now rounded via `roundTo`** (cp/cpk/cpu/cpl/withinSpecPercent to 4 dp, sigmaLevel to 2 dp), consistent with `ppk()` and the library-wide rounding convention. Previously `cpk()` returned full-precision floats.

### Deprecated

- **`PpkResult.ppUpper` / `ppLower` / `sigma`** — superseded by `ppu` / `ppl` / `sigmaLevel` for symmetry with `cpk()`. The old fields remain available (identical values) and will be removed in a future release. Note `sigma` was a misleading name — it holds the sigma *level* (3 × Ppk), not the standard deviation.

### Fixed

- **ERRORS.md accuracy** — `cpk()`, `ppk()`, and `cmk()` were documented as throwing on `stdDev = 0` (the `cpk()` row also wrongly claimed it returns `Infinity`), but all three intentionally return a zero-valued result (verified by tests). Corrected the per-function tables and added an explicit note that the capability-index family is exempt from the "validation failures → throw" rule.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed

- **Subpath exports** — added a `default` condition to every subpath in `package.json` `exports`. Previously only the `import` condition was present, causing `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` when consumed from CJS contexts (e.g. the `tsx` test runner). ESM consumers are unaffected.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **New IE (Industrial Engineering) domain** (`formulab/ie`) with 5 functions: `standardTime`, `timeStudy`, `workSampling`, `vaAnalysis`, `learningCurve`.
- **New quality (FMEA/SPC) functions**: `actionPriority` (AIAG-VDA 2019 AP matrix), `cpkToOccurrence` (Cpk → FMEA occurrence mapping), `nelsonRules` (SPC control-chart 8 rules).

### Fixed

- **`learningCurve()` unit vs cumulative model** — the two models previously produced identical results. The unit model now sums individual unit times and the cumulative model derives unit time from cumulative totals.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **`throw new Error` → `throw new RangeError`** across all 18 remaining files — runtime error type now matches `@throws {RangeError}` JSDoc and ERRORS.md policy. Affected domains: automotive, chemical, construction, electronics, energy, environmental, machining, metal, quality, safety.

### Changed

- **README.md** — Updated test count (2,494), error handling section (no legacy NaN/Infinity), utility domain (3 → 16 functions).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-09

### Breaking Changes

- **`awgProperties()` return type** — Changed from `AwgResult | null` to `AwgResult`. Invalid AWG range (< 0 or > 40) now throws `RangeError` instead of returning `null`.
- **`metalWeight()`** — Now throws `RangeError` on non-positive dimensions (length, width, thickness, diameter) and when outerDiameter ≤ innerDiameter for pipes.
- **`cRate()`** — Now throws `RangeError` when capacityAh ≤ 0, currentA ≤ 0, or cRate ≤ 0. Previously returned `Infinity`.
- **`toolDeflection()`** — Now throws `RangeError` on non-positive toolDiameter/stickout or negative cuttingForce. Stiffness is computed as `3EI/L³` (beam property) instead of `F/δ`.
- **`boringBarDeflection()`** — Same changes as `toolDeflection()`: validation + stiffness formula fix.
- **`heatTransfer()`** — All `throw new Error()` changed to `throw new RangeError()`. Removed `Infinity` fallback in radiation thermal resistance.

### Added

- **`@throws` JSDoc annotations** for 14 functions across 10 domains — documents every throw condition for IDE/editor hints:
  - automotive: `brakingDistance`
  - chemical: `heatTransfer`, `pipeFlow`
  - construction: `aggregate`, `momentOfInertia`
  - electronics: `ohmsLaw`, `stencil`
  - energy: `solarOutput`
  - environmental: `scope2Emissions`
  - machining: `triangleSolver`
  - metal: `flangeSpec`, `pipeSpec`
  - quality: `controlChart`
  - safety: `ventilationRate`

- **26 new validation tests** — error path coverage for `metalWeight`, `cRate`, `toolDeflection`, `boringBarDeflection`, `heatTransfer`, `awgProperties`

### Changed

- **ERRORS.md** — Removed legacy migration roadmap (all NaN/Infinity patterns resolved). Updated all 6 function entries to reflect `throw` behavior.
- Total test count: 2468 → 2494 (+26)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-06

### Breaking Changes
- **`MetalWeightInput`**: Now a discriminated union by `shape`. Each shape variant requires its specific fields (e.g., `shape: 'plate'` requires `width` and `thickness`). The `materialName` field is now a `MaterialName` literal union type instead of `string`.
- **`DilutionInput`**: Now a discriminated union by `solveFor`. Each variant provides exactly the three known values, eliminating optional fields and `!` assertions.
- **`ReactorInput`**: Now a discriminated union by `shape`. `shape: 'cylindrical'` requires `height`; `shape: 'spherical'` does not accept `height`.
- **`BoltInput`**: Now a discriminated union by `mode`. `mode: 'torqueToPreload'` requires `torque`; `mode: 'preloadToTorque'` requires `preload`.
- **QR code types removed**: `QrcodeInput`, `QrcodeResult`, `ErrorCorrectionLevel` types and `qrcode.ts` module removed from `formulab/utility` (was empty shell with no implementation).

### Enhanced
- **`roundTo()`**: Fixed negative number rounding (`-2.555` now correctly rounds to `-2.56` instead of `-2.55`). Uses sign-aware epsilon correction.
- **`oee()`**: Results now consistently rounded via `roundTo()` (factors to 4 decimals, percentages to 1 decimal).

### Fixed
- **Duplicate code removal**: Consolidated `normalCDF()`, `normalInvCDF()`, and `clamp()` from 6 files into shared `math.ts` module.
- **`Math.round` inconsistency**: Replaced manual `Math.round(x * N) / N` patterns with `roundTo()` in 8 files (`metalWeight`, `fallClearance`, `welding`, `carbonFootprint`, `powerCost`, `bendAllowance`, `weldHeat`, `roughness`).
- **Duplicate test file**: Removed `src/metal/pressTonnage.test.ts` (14 duplicate tests); canonical version at `src/metal/__tests__/pressTonnage.test.ts` (19 tests) retained.

### Changed
- **Coverage thresholds**: Raised from baseline (5% lines) to realistic levels (90% lines, 95% functions, 85% branches, 90% statements).
- Total test count: 1630 tests across 102 test files.
